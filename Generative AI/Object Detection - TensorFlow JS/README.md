Object Detection - WebML with TensorFlow JS
==============================

In this project I will use TensorFlow JS Pre-Trained COCO-SSD model for object detection and boundary boxes.

It can run on static images as well as live webcam stream.

## Agenda

- Load Pre-Trained TensorFlow JS model
- Fetch data stream from webcam or images
- Classify image frames from camera frame to find objects
- Highlight found objects with boundary boxes


## Benefits of Pre-Trained Models

- No need for training data and model training
- Rapid prototyping
- State of the art Models
- Easier to use, good documentation
- Transfer Learning for some models


## COCO-SSD Models - (Microsoft)

- COCO stands for Common Objects in Context
- SSD is Single Shot Detection Architecture
