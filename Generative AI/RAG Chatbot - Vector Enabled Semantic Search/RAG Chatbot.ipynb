We promised to lower their taxes, step up our efforts to protect the \\nFrench language, improve education and health services and protect our environment. Que becers then placed their trust in us a second time. We are now \\ncommitted to getting the work done for them. \\nThe government is continuing the efforts of the past four years. Budget 2023- 2024 \\nprioritizes the economy, education, health and the environment, while maintaining \\na prudent and responsible financial framework. \\nToday, I am proud to announce one of the largest tax cuts in the history of Québec. \\nThe two bottom tax rates will be reduced by 1 percentage point starting this year. This tax cut will total $9.2 billion by 2027- 2028 and will \\nbenefit 4.6 million Quebecers. \\n\\uf071The year 2023, a period of transition \\nWe ended our last term with a promise to Quebecers: we promised to help them cope with the rising cost of living. And that’s what we did. Using the Anti -Inflation \\nShield, we have helped all Quebecers affected by the rising cost of living. \\nMadam President, of all the governments in Canada, ours has done the most \\nto protect its people from inflation. \\nThe year 2023 will be a period of transition for the global economy, marking a shift from a period of turbulence to a more stable economic context. \\n\\uf8e7 In early 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic caused a shock of unprecedented \\nmagnitude,  sending the economy into a short but deep recession. \\n\\uf8e7 The economic recovery and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine then created an \\nenvironment that is conducive to accelerating inflationary pressures. \\n\\uf8e7 The rising cost of living and deteriorating credit conditions will weigh on global \\neconomic expansion in the coming quarters. Most regions will experience a \\nsignificant slowdown in economic activity in 2023. \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 3  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n          \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n         \\n         \\n     \\n \\n  \\n            \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n Controlling inflation should help restore an environment that is conducive to \\nsustainable growth as of 2 024. \\nThis budget has been prepared with all these things in mind. \\nMadam President, it is undeniable that Québec will see an economic slowdown \\nin 2023. The risks of a recession are still present, but Québec’s resilience means \\nthat we can be optimistic about our chances of escaping one. \\nThe economy is projected to grow by 0.6% in 2023 and 1.4% in 2024. \\nIt is also important to remember that employment growth in Québec was strong, \\nexceeding expectations. \\nIn addition, we have continued to make progress toward closing the wealth gap with \\nOntario. Although growth in living standards was similar in Québec and Ontario in \\nthe years before our government came to power, we have managed to reduce the \\nwealth gap by nearly 3 percentage points since we took office. Our government is maintaining its goal of reducing this gap to less than 10% by the end of 2026 and will intensify its efforts to achieve this. \\nOf course, improving the standard of living is important, but it is not an end in itself. \\nThe premier as often said so. The goal is to collectively give ourselves the means \\nto achieve our ambitions. \\n\\uf071Québec is committed to delivering services to the population \\nMadam President, this budget reflects the government’s determination to fulfil l its \\nmain commitments to the benefit of the entire population. To achieve this, we intend \\nto focus on: \\n\\uf8e7 increasing Québec’s economic potential; \\n\\uf8e7 developing the potential of youth to ensure the future of Québec society; \\n\\uf8e7 continuing to roll out the health plan; \\n\\uf8e7 diversifying and consolidating environmental measures; \\n\\uf8e7 maintaining sound public finances over time. \\nIn total, this budget provides for $24.5 billion in investments by 2027- 2028. \\nMajor steps have been taken since fall 2018 to improve business productivity, \\nsupport innovation and promote workers’ integration and job retention. \\nInitiatives of more than $12 billion by 2027- 2028 are planned to grow Québec’s \\nwealth. \\nMoreover,  investing in the future of Québec means investing in its young people. \\nEducation is our top priority. To make sure that young people enjoy school and \\nto foster student retention and graduation rates, we plan to invest $2.3 billion. \\nBudget Speech \\n2023- 2024 4  \\n \\n       \\n   \\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n           \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n      \\n       \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  When it comes to health care, everyone agrees that changes are needed. That’s \\nwhy we have invested so much in recent years. \\nIn keeping with the health plan, our government is continuing to transform the \\nnetwork. As a result, nearly $5.6 billion is being provided to make the health care system more humane and more effective. \\nThe government is investing nearly $3.6 billion to support Quebecers. This amount \\nmeans that they will be able to count on more affordable housing units and better \\naccess to childcare services and the justice system, for example. They will also benefit from safer and more inclusive living envir onments. \\nIn addition, the budget provides nearly $650 million to promote the French language and Québec’s culture. \\n\\uf071Diversifying and consolidating environmental measures \\nMadam President, our government is the one that has done the most for the environment in recent years. \\nAt the United Nations Conference on Biodiversity, COP15, our government made \\nstrong commitments concerning the implementation of the Plan nature 2030 and pledged to protect Québec’s water reserves. \\nAs a result, $1 billion is being provided to diversify and consolidate environmental \\nmeasures, including the creation of the Fonds bleu and the implementation of the Plan nature. \\nWe are also continuing with our 2030 Plan for a Green Economy. \\nToday, I am announcing a $1.4 billion enhancement to the new \\n2023- 2028 implementation plan. In total, this plan will receive an \\nenvelope of $9 billion. \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 5  \\n      \\n          \\n          \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n       \\n  \\n      \\n         \\n   \\n       \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\uf071Ambitious targets for sound management of public finances \\nWe are committed, Madam President, to accomplishing all of this and much more. \\nMoreover, we must also manage Québec’s public finances in a prudent and \\nresponsible manner. That has been a priority for us since 2018, as we are the trustees of Québec’s public finances. \\nToday, I am announcing the lifting of the suspension and the modernization of t he Balanced Budget Act . \\nThe financial framework of Budget 2023- 2024 is prudent and provides for declining \\ndeficits that will enable us to return to a balanced budget by 2027- 2028 while: \\n\\uf8e7 reducing personal income tax; \\n\\uf8e7 fostering economic growth; \\n\\uf8e7 adequately funding the government’s missions. \\nIt bears repeating, Madam President, that our financial framework includes \\nsignificant, stable and predictable funding for the government’s main missions. That \\nhas also been the case in each of our previous budgets. \\nSince we took office in 2018, annual growth in education spending has averaged 6%. \\nWe are maintaining that level this year . It is a priority for us. \\nSpending on higher education and health and social services will grow by 5% and 7.7% , respectively, this year. \\nQuébec’s public infrastructure needs are significant , and we are choosing to meet \\nthem, Madam President. \\nThat’s why I am announcing that the 2023- 2033 Québec Infrastructure \\nPlan, the QIP, has been increased to $150 billion. That is an increase \\nof $7.5 billion compared to the previous QIP. \\nThese record investments will significantly improve the quality of our infrastructure and will meet transportation, health and education needs throughout Québec. \\nQuébec has made remarkable progress in reducing its debt in recent decades, but \\nit remains one of the most indebted provinces. \\nBudget Speech \\n2023- 2024 6  \\n \\n    \\n         \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n\\uf097\\uf096\\uf096To ensure that there is long -term funding for the government’s main missions and a \\nprosperous future for the next generations, we will continue to make reducing the \\ndebt burden one of our priorities. \\nToday, I am announcing a new objective: net debt will be reduced to 30% \\nof GDP by 2037- 2038. Québec’s net debt burden will therefore gradually \\nmove toward the current average of the provinces. \\nI am also announcing that deposits in the Generations Fund will reach \\n$2.4 billion in 2023- 2024 and will then continue to increase gradually. \\nMadam President, we are firmly committed to achieving our objectives for the benefit of all Quebecers. \\nI would now like to go into more detail about the various measures that our \\ngovernment will roll out using this budget. \\n* * * \\nI am therefore asking for the National Assembly’s consent to table the following documents: \\n\\uf8e7 the tables presenting the preliminary results of the consolidated budgetary \\ntransactions for 2022- 2023; \\n\\uf8e7 the forecasts for the 2023- 2024 financial framework. \\nI am also tabling the March 2023 Budget Plan and the companion documents, which \\nare an integral part of the budget. \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 7  \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  1. GROWING QUÉBEC ’S WEALTH \\nMadam President, the government has set ambitious objectives for creating wealth \\nand increasing Québec’s economic potential. \\nTo achieve them, the government is planning more than $12 billion in initia tives \\nas part of this budget between now and 2027- 2028. \\n* * * \\nLOWERING TAXES \\nQuébec has the highest tax burden in Canada. The personal income tax to GDP \\nratio was 14. 7% in 2021. \\nBy reducing the amount taken from personal income, we are improving people’s ability to consume and save. \\nFurthermore, personal income tax has a negative impact on labour supply. We are using all the tools at our disposal to combat the labour shortage. \\nTo increase Quebecers’ disposable income, the government has committed \\nto reducing  their tax burden and we are following through on that commitment. \\nAs a result, 75% of the $9.2- billion tax cut will go to Quebecers who earn less \\nthan $10 0 000. \\nLet me be very clear, Madam President: the reduction in the tax burden of Quebecers \\nwill not occur at the expense of public services in Québec at any time or in any way. \\nWe are also not questioning the objective of reducing the debt burden or the \\nimportance of the Generations Fund. \\nThis tax cut will be funded by more moderate growth in deposit s in the Generations \\nFund. As a note, when the fund was established, it received deposits in the hundreds \\nof millions of dollars. We now expect to deposit $2.8 billion in the fund in 2027- 2028 \\nand nearly $5 billion in 2037- 2038. \\n* * * \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 9  \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n INCREASING THE PROD UCTIVITY OF QUÉBEC ’S ECONOMY \\nIn addition to these efforts to increase Quebecers’ disposable income, we will make \\nsure to increase the productivity of Québec’s economy. Therefore, $888 million over five years has been provided for this purpose. \\nIn the context of the labour shortage, we must focus on productivity gains. Therefore, \\nwe intend to focus on: \\n\\uf8e7 stimulating private investment to accelerate economic growth; \\n\\uf8e7 stepping up efforts in innovation; \\n\\uf8e7 promoting business growth, digitization and exports. \\n\\uf071Implementing the new tax holiday for large investment projects \\nOne of the main tools Québec has to stimulate business growth is the tax holiday for \\nlarge investment projects, a measure that will expire on December 31, 2024. \\nTo stimulate productivity gains, I am announcing the introduction of a new tax holiday for large investment projects of over $100 million. \\nCompared to the current measure, the new tax holiday will: \\n\\uf8e7 reach a greater number of activity sectors; \\n\\uf8e7 provide an enhanced incentive that could now represent up to 25% of \\ninvestments, depending on the location of the project in Québec. \\nThe new tax holiday will provide $373 million in financial support to businesses over \\nthe next five years. It will support the implementation of nearly 100 new projects \\nin Québec by the end of 2029, ultimately generating investments totalling more \\nthan $24 billion. \\n\\uf071Continuing to develop innovation zones \\nInnovation zones are central to the economic vision of the premier and our government. They foster real collaboration between university researchers and large \\nbusinesses in the aim of promoting innovation marketing, export growth, investment \\nand business productivity. \\nIn February 2022, our government unveiled the first two innovation zones, in \\nSherbrooke and Bromont. \\nTo accelerate the creation of innovation zones, the government is providing \\n$100 million over five years. These investments will position Québec as an \\ninternational player in innovation and will facilitate talent attraction and retention. \\n* * * \\nBudget Speech \\n2023- 2024 10  \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROSPERITY OF THE REGIONS \\nOur regions are crucial when it comes to increasing collective wealth in Québec. \\nOur government will support prosperity in the regions with investments totalling \\n$1.4 billion. We intend to focus on: \\n\\uf8e7 supporting the growth of the bio- food sector; \\n\\uf8e7 stimulating regional economic vitality; \\n\\uf8e7 ensuring the development and promotion of our tourist attractions; \\n\\uf8e7 fostering the development of the forestry sector ; \\n\\uf8e7 continuing the actions for better connectivity; \\n\\uf8e7 harnessing the value of Québec’s subsurface minerals. \\n\\uf071Increasing Québec’s food autonomy \\nThe goal of greater food autonomy requires, n otably , a greater capacity to offer \\nQuebecers fresh, healthy and diversified food. \\nTo increase Québec’s food autonomy, this budget provides $175 million to enhance \\nthe programs of the Ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation. \\n\\uf071Supporting an innovative, evolving and sustainable tourism \\noffering \\nOur government is supporting tourism industry investment with an amount \\nof $75 million, including $45 million to extend the Program Supporting the \\nDevelopment of Tourist Attractions. \\n\\uf071Rolling out cellular technology initiatives \\nSince 2021, Operation High Speed has reached a very high number of Québec households, providing them with access to a reliable and secure high- speed Internet \\nconnection. \\nThe government is now setting new objectives to provide all regions of Québec with \\naccess to a fibre- optic network and to extend the 5G cellular network across all \\ninhabited areas of Québec. \\nAs a result, the government plans to invest $109 million to reach the next milestones \\nto better connectivity for Quebecers and businesses. \\n* * * \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 11  \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n        \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n  ADDRESSING THE LABOUR SHORTAGE \\nMadam President, our government is particularly sensitive to the situation of the \\nQuébec workforce. It is the powerhouse of our economic vitality. We are aware that \\nthe current shortage combined with an aging population will present challenges for years to come. It is therefore our responsibility to better integrate immigrants into the labour market. \\nOpération main-d’œuvre was launched in fall 2021 in order to match workers’ skills \\nwith the needs of Québec employers.

We wish to provide all young people in Québec with the \\ntools to achieve their ambitions and choose plans for their future that suit them. They \\nwill be better equipped to do so with training that reflects their aspirations. \\nTherefore, an amount of $2.3 billion is being invested in education and higher \\neducation.

The acquisition of knowledge and skills by the population remains a top priority. We also believe that all young Quebecers who wish to do so should be able to fulfil l their potential by accessing higher education. \\nI am announcing additional investments of $717 million over five years \\nwith a view to: \\n\\uf8e7 financially supporting students; \\n\\uf8e7 improving higher education graduation rates; \\n\\uf8e7 enhancing the culture of innovation and supporting the adoption \\nof tec hnological advances. \\n\\uf071Financially supporting students \\nDue to the rising cost of living, particularly in relation to housing, the government is \\nmaking the increase in living expenses considered in the calculation of student loans and bursaries permanent. \\nThis renewal represents an additional $351 million in financial support for \\napproximately 80 000 students. \\nIn addition, the merit scholarships administered by the Fonds de recherche du \\nQuébec are a powerful tool for promoting research and attracting and retaining talent. The government is providing $50 million to enhance these scholarships for \\nthe scientific community. \\n\\uf071Welcoming more French -speaking international students \\nThe granting of additional tuition exemptions allows select international students to pay the same fees as Québec students.

MAKING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MORE EFFECTIVE \\nAND MORE HUMANE \\nMadam President, our health and social services system was put under great strain \\nduring the pandemic. The government learned from this experience and launched the plan to reform health care in March 2022. It thereby initiated a major shift in order to meet the many challenges still present in this sector. \\nIn this budget, we are investing nearly $5.6 billion in the aim of: \\n\\uf8e7 making the health care system more efficient and more flexible for the public; \\n\\uf8e7 caring for seniors and informal and family caregivers; \\n\\uf8e7 supporting the most vulnerable. \\n* * * \\nMAKING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT AND FLEXIBLE \\nFOR THE PUBLIC \\nWith its health care plan, the government has been reshaping the organization of \\nhealth care to improve network performance for close to a year now . \\nToday, the government is planning new initiatives totalling more than $3 billion in \\norder to make the health care system more efficient and flexible with a view to: \\n\\uf8e7 adapting the health sector to post -pandemic realities; \\n\\uf8e7 improving care and services through lasting structural changes; \\n\\uf8e7 supporting the creation of Santé Québec. \\n\\uf071Adapting the health sector to post -pandemic realities \\nThe pandemic required rapid adaptation of the health care system. Maintaining many \\nof the innovative solutions implemented during the emergency will have a positive and lasting impact on Quebecers’ health. We also know that one of the keys to improving access to health care lies in prevention. \\nIn addition, offloading caused by the various waves of the pandemic has resulted in longer wait times for surgeries and clinical activities. This is why the strategy put in place to increase surgical activity in 2021 will be maintained and extended. \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 21  \\n      \\n    \\n        \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n      \\n    \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The government is providing more than $2.2 billion to adapt the health care system \\nto post -pandemic realities. This will make it possible to focus on: \\n\\uf8e7 sustaining the new approach developed for vaccination and testing, expanding \\nits reach to other front -line services; \\n\\uf8e7 updating the emergency preparedness plan and personal protective equipment \\nprocurement; \\n\\uf8e7 reducing the waiting list for surgeries. \\n\\uf071Improving health care and services through lasting structural \\nchanges \\nAn additional $710 million will make it possible to focus on: \\n\\uf8e7 opening new front -line-access clinics and add ing specialized nurse practitioners \\nand other front -line professionals; \\n\\uf8e7 developing the “Votre Santé” platform; \\n\\uf8e7 establishing a helicopter medical transportation service; \\n\\uf8e7 improving the management of patients suffering from rare or chronic diseases. \\n\\uf0a1Opening new front -line-access clinics and adding specialized \\nnurse practitioners and other front -line professionals \\nSince 2021, specialized nurse practitioners, or SNPs, have been given more \\nresponsibilities and greater autonomy. They can make more diagnoses, prescribe \\nexaminations, medication and treatment plans, and monitor pregnancies. \\nContinuing this initiative, we plan to invest $395 million to open 23 new SNP clinics \\nin Québec. \\n\\uf0a1Developing the “Votre Santé” platform to facilitate appointment \\nbooking \\nSince June 2022, the government has made it possible to roll out an \\nappointment -management platform. The “Votre Santé” platform will build on the \\nsuccess of the vaccination campaign with “Clic Santé” and will also facilitate the adoption of telemedicine. \\nAs a result, we are earmarking $146 million to develop this platform. \\n* * * \\nBudget Speech \\n2023- 2024 22  \\n \\n    \\n     \\n \\n   \\n   \\n        \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n          \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n CARING FOR SENIORS AND INFORMAL AND FAMILY CAREGIVERS \\nIn this budget, we have also committed to continuing efforts to take better care of \\nseniors and informal and family caregivers. \\nIn Québec, the proportion of people aged 65 and over is continually increasing. It will \\nincrease from 21% in 2022 to 26% in 2041. \\nTherefore, the government is earmarking nearly $2 billion for seniors and informal \\nand family caregivers. \\n\\uf071Increasing the supply of home-support services \\nMadam President, in our last term, we made a commitment to make it easier for seniors  to stay in their homes. We want to enable them to live and grow old in their \\nown homes for as long as they can. \\nI am announcing an investment of $964 million in the aim of: \\n\\uf8e7 providing services to an additional 34 000 people; \\n\\uf8e7 increasing the provision of home- support services by more than \\n13.5 million hours annually. \\nThis means that, since 2018- 2019, the additional amounts announced for home \\nsupport have totalled nearly $6.5 billion. \\n\\uf071Ensuring the sustainability of services in private seniors’ \\nresidences \\nPrivate seniors’ residences, or PSRs, are an essential partner of the public health \\ncare system when it comes to home- support services for seniors. \\nThe government has taken steps to ensure the sustainability of the services offered. \\nHowever, residences continue to close down because of significant increases in operational costs, such as those associated with labour, insurance and certification. \\nWe are continuing our efforts to ensure the sustainability of services in PSRs. In this \\nbudget, $405 million is being invested in the aim of: \\n\\uf8e7 maintaining services to seniors; \\n\\uf8e7 extending the financial assistance program for installing sprinklers. \\nIn addition, the program to reduce the impact of insurance premium increases on PSRs will be extended by one year. \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 23  \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\uf0a1Maintaini ng services offered in private seniors’ residences \\nTo ensure that seniors living in PSRs continue to obtain the services they need, \\n$316 million is being set aside in the aim of: \\n\\uf8e7 improving the direct allocation mechanism for clients with diminishing autono my; \\n\\uf8e7 updating the intervention framework for small residences; \\n\\uf8e7 expanding the salary transition program for caregiving staff. \\n* * * \\nBudget Speech \\n2023- 2024 24  \\n \\n   \\n \\n       \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n       \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf097\\uf096\\uf096SUPPORTING THE MOST VULNERABLE \\nIn recent years, significant investments have been made to enhance mental health \\nand social services.

SUPPORTING QUEBECERS \\nMadam President, I would now like to talk about what we propose to support \\nQuebecers in their daily lives. I’m talking about their lives as families and in their \\ncommunities and environments. \\nIn this regard, the government is pursuing its commitments to support families, \\ncommunity organizations and people in vulnerable situations. In addition, significant \\ninvestments have been made to improve our living environments and enhance access to transportation. \\nWe will invest $3.6 billion to better meet the needs of Quebecers. \\nWe will promote access to affordable housing and support families, vulnerable \\nindividuals and First Nations and Inuit people. \\n* * * \\nPROMOTING CULTURE AND THE FRENCH LANGUAGE \\nCulture contributes to promoting and shaping Québec’s identity. In addition to representing a major sector of our economy, cultural industries promote Québec here and abroad. \\nIntimately linked to Québec culture, the French language is the cornerstone of \\nQuébec’s identity. It is alive and rich. The government is therefore committed \\nto protecting, preserving and advancing our common language in Québec. \\nAccordingly, I am announcing nearly $650 million to promote Québec culture and the French language. \\n\\uf071Promoting Québec culture \\nInitiatives totalling $561 million will be aimed at: \\n\\uf8e7 giving new impetus to cultural development; \\n\\uf8e7 deploying Québec’s creativity in the digital realm; \\n\\uf8e7 promoting Québec culture and increasing its dissemination and accessibility. \\nTo achieve these goals, I am announcing: \\n\\uf8e7 $300 million to continue the government culture action plan for \\nthe next five years; \\n\\uf8e7 $200 million to be made available to the Société de \\ndéveloppement des entreprises culturelles, SODEC, to increase \\nthe industry’s outreach. \\nA Committed \\nQuébec 27  \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\uf0a1Reaffirming the role of Télé- Québec in youth programming \\nFor more than 50 years, Télé- Québec has been providing Quebecers with quality \\nFrench- language content. \\nThe government is providing $101 million for Télé -Québec to reaffirm its role in youth \\nprogramming and enhance its service offering on its different platforms. The channel \\nwill thus be able to propose an original and renewed service offering. \\n\\uf071Advancing the French language \\nThe defence, promotion and advancement of the French language are priorities for \\nthe government. In May 2022, we adopted the Act respecting French, the official and \\ncommon language of Québec . \\nToday, the government continues to take action. The budget provides $88 million to \\nensure the implementation of the legislative changes related to this Act by supporting the Ministère de la Langue française and the Office québécois de la langue française. \\n* * * \\nFACILITATING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING \\nThe Québec government recognizes how important it is for households to live in quality housing that suits their financial capacity. However, recent years have seen a sharp rise in rental costs, making it hard for certain households to meet this need. \\nTo facilita te access to affordable housing, I am announcing a $1- billion \\ninvestment with a view to: \\n\\uf8e7 increasing and maintaining the social and affordable housing \\nstock, in particular by allowing for the construction of more \\nthan 5 250 housing units; \\n\\uf8e7 enhancing the housing component of the refundable solidarity \\ntax credit; \\n\\uf8e7 allocating an additional 2 000 units under the Rent Supplement \\nProgram. \\n* * * \\nBudget Speech \\n2023- 2024 28  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  SUPPORTING FAMILIES \\nThe government wishes to support Québec families in a practical way.
